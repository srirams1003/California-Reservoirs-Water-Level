<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Installation
I will assume that you have Node.js installed and that you are in the root directory of this repository.
Once you have the above packages installed, execute the steps below.

* installing backend dependencies
  ```sh
  cd BackendWaterLevel
  npm install
  ```
* installing frontend dependencies
  ```sh
  cd ../FrontendWaterLevel
  npm install
  ```



### Running
Assuming here that you have executed all the steps in the "Installation" phase above correctly. Next:

* Return to the root directory of the repository first. Then, open two different terminal/shell instances:

* On the first instance, run this:
  ```sh
  cd BackendWaterLevel
  node index.js
  ```

* On the second instance, run this:
  ```sh
  cd FrontendWaterLevel
  npm run dev
  ```
